## 1. Overview

Everyone can see available positions of all departments with its related information. For example, position's name, position department, start date, end date (deadline), expected salary (per hour), description (basic/advanced requirements, benefits, location, etc..).

Only registed users can apply for a position. Guests can register to the system by supported buttons (such as Sign-up button).

When registering to the system, each user must have unique username and email. The system won't allow 2 users have the same either username or email. However, guests only need to provide their username and password when they register to the system (email or other personal information can be added later).

## 2. Maintaining the registed User Privilege 

 * Registed Users (RUs) can apply for a position (or many) and keep track on their applications and personal information after logged in to the system.
  
 * In addition, RUs can also upload related files to the system for each application.
   
 * RUs will be notified as long as their applications' status have changed. There are 4 types of status: Pending, Processing, Hired, or Declined.
 
## 3. Maintaining the Staff Privilege 

* Every staff can login/out to the system by using provided buttons.

* After logged in, staff will be able to check their personal information as well as edit it. However, they can't edit their department, staff, admin or super admin status. 

* Each staff will be able to view all positions and searches related to them if they are selected as a committee.

* If a staff is chosen as a chair of a search or a department (they will be considered as an admin), they can create searches for positions, access and approve any related documents (latest version of a document) as well as update the applications' status.

* Staff can create, view and update logs for each search they are working on. 

* Each staff can create documents, revisions, and upload files. On top of that, only the creator of documents (also revisions and files) can modify as well as download their own files.

* If a staff is assigned as an admin (even if they are not a chair of a search or a department), they will be able to do whatever an admin can do.

## 4. Maintaining the Admin Privilege 

* The admin, technically, can perform any operations that a staff can do, but not super admins' privilliges.

* The admin can also see the list of staff of their department.

* The admin can approve any documents and access to any applications or logs, searches, etc.. to anything relates to their department.

* An admin **cannot** create/delete a department as well as users (those operations related to departments and users are performed by super admins). However, admins (or a chair of a department) can assign users to be a committee of searches. In addition, admins also can change staff's type. For example, making a user become a staff, admin (but not super admin)

## 5. Maintaining the Super Admin Privilege

* Simply, a super admin can do everything related to the system. For example, assign/unassign a user to a staff, admin or even super admin.

* On top of that, only super admin can modify or delete departments' information.
